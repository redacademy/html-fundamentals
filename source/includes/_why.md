# Why HTML?

__HTML__ (HyperText Markup Language) is what we use to display content on web pages.
It is (relatively) succinct, quick to learn, and implemented in a (more or less) standard way across every web browser, including browsers on mobile devices.

This means that once you learn how to write well-formed HTML, it can be run on any device, anywhere.
Don't underestimate how powerful that can be.

HTML is not a programming language, as it doesn't _do_ anything.
It simply defines defines layouts using [Elements](#elements) and their [Attributes](#attributes).
HTML has more elements than you'll ever actually need.
The purpose of this resource is to teach you some of the most common elements and how to use them.
